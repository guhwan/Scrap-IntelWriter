passage = "The potato is a root vegetable native to the Americas, a starchy tuber of the plant Solanum tuberosum, and the plant itself is a " \
          "perennial in the nightshade family, Solanaceae." \
          "[2]Wild potato species, originating in modern-day Peru, can be found throughout the Americas, from the United States to " \
          "southern Chile.[3] The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated by indigenous peoples of the Americas " \
          "independently in multiple locations,[4] but later genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species traced a " \
          "single origin for potatoes. In the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia, from a species in " \
          " Solanum brevicaule complex, potatoes were domesticated approximately 7,000–10,000 years ago.[5][6][7] In the Andes " \
          "region of South America, where the species is indigenous, some close relatives of the potato are cultivated." \
          "Potatoes were introduced to Europe from the Americas in the second half of the 16th century by the Spanish. " \
          "Today they are a staple food in many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world's food supply. " \
          "As of 2014, potatoes were the world's fourth-largest food crop after maize (corn), wheat, and rice.[8]Following " \
          "millennia of selective breeding, there are now over 5,000 different types of potatoes.[6] Over 99% of presently " \
          "cultivated potatoes worldwide descended from varieties that originated in the lowlands of south-central Chile.[9][10]The " \
          "importance of the potato as a food source and culinary ingredient varies by region and is still changing. It remains an " \
          "essential crop in Europe, especially Northern and Eastern Europe, where per capita production is still the highest in the " \
          "world, while the most rapid expansion in production over the past few decades has occurred in southern and eastern Asia, " \
          "with China and India leading the world in overall production as of 2018.Like the tomato, the potato is a nightshade in the " \
          "genus Solanum, and the vegetative and fruiting parts of the potato contain the toxin solanine which is dangerous for human " \
          "consumption. Normal potato tubers that have been grown and stored properly produce glycoalkaloids in amounts small enough " \
          "to be negligible to human health, but if green sections of the plant (namely sprouts and skins) are exposed to light, the " \
          "tuber can accumulate a high enough concentration of glycoalkaloids to affect human health.[11][12] "
